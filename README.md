# Deep Learning Toolkit
My own DL toolkit to be reused in different projects.

My research topic is image registration, so many codes are for registration purpose.

This repository will be updated occasionally.

- [x] random elastic transformation generation and visualizer
- [x] Jacobian determinant calculation
- [x] generate checkerboard of 2 images
- [x] preprocessing script for 3 datasets
- [x] script for `gdb-icp`

### Basic: 

- [x] encapsulation for `visdom`

## 2 Cheat sheet :memo:
